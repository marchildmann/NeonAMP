# NeonAMP
NeonAmp is a lightweight, self-hosted MP3 player with a glowing 80s aesthetic and modern features. Built with PHP 8.3+, Vanilla JavaScript, and SQLite, it scans your music library, parses ID3 tags, and delivers a smooth, keyboard-controlled listening experience—no bloated frameworks, just pure retro-futuristic vibes.
